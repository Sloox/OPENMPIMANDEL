# OPENMPI-MANDEL
A simple C project that makes use of MPI to calculate the initial image of the Mandelbrot set.
It constructs a PPM image (will need to find a PPM view to view it, something like http://openseeit.sourceforge.net/) of the first inital image of the Madelbrot set.

It was apart of a larger set of work on the parallelization of the madelbrot set.

Makes use of OPENMPI https://www.open-mpi.org/software/ompi/v2.1/
Most likely can be run on windows with cmake @ https://cmake.org/
Recommend using linux.
